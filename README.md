Ugh, my back is killing me from those theater seats. Seriously. But wow, just WOW. The Wedding Banquet is playing my brain like it’s yatzee. Imagine trying to ride an emotional rollercoaster but the track is made of spaghetti?! Chaos, but like, delicious, comfort-food chaos.

Oh, so Ma was yelling at me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   next time, but then I remember that one scene—the parents with the dumplings! Like, those dumplings could solve world peace, I swear. If only they knew my theater popcorn tastes like cardboard in comparison. My mouth is jealous, mouth-envy should be a thing. 

K-classic “you’re in a love triangle but one party is secretly not a triangle” and WHO thought that throwing a wedding like it was a game of charades was normal? And Simon—gosh, wading through that awkward Bliss-Field-married-without-being-married field. If that even makes sense. Sometimes I felt like I was in that room, Lawrence of Arabia-style drama but with extra servings of cultural confusion. All crammed into a hall that smells like stale popcorn.

> Out of nowhere, the theater's AC decides to turn the place into a tundra, and it’s NOT helping me process my state of emotional saturation. The moment when Wei-Tung is caught between filial duty and love... It’s like trying to choose between two favorite childhood toys or two different ice cream flavors melting in the sun.

The part with those sassy elders critiquing everything like fashion judges—kind of how my relatives discuss politics over dinner—still ringing in my ears over the crunching noises from Jana trying to empty the popcorn. My ears. I might be half deaf until tomorrow.

I just put in my text notes REMEMBER TO 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with Rebecca. Wasn’t she the one scarfs and gluten 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 bread? Anyway, that restaurant scene—could drown in symbolism there. Or soy sauce. Maybe both.

if (int i = 0; i < theaterRow.length; i++) {
    popcorn[i].consume();
    tryToFocus(emotions[i]);
}

It’s probably not even running. Just trying to process all this.
